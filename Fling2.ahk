;; Fling2 replaced Win+Left and Win+Right by using thirds and halfs instead of only halfs in a monitor setup with a ultra wide monitor 
;; It uses thirds on a ultra wide monitor (e.g. LG 34UC98-W) and halfs on standard 16:9/16:10 monitors
;; It also supports doubleColumns when using thirds, so that one windows can use 2/3 of the screen and another 1/3440x1440
;; -----------------------------------------------------------------------
;; Fling2 is based on Fling from Patrick Sheppard (2010)
;; Thank you very much for your great work!

;; Fling (or shift) a window between columns and monitors in a multi-monitor system, using thirds on ultra wide monitors and halfs on wide screen monitors.
;;
;; Function Parameters:
;;
;;      FlingDirection      The direction of the fling, expected to be either +1 or -1.
;;                          The function is not limited to just two monitors; it supports
;;                          as many monitors as are currently connected to the system and
;;                          can fling a window serially through each of them in turn.
;;
;;      WinID               The window ID of the window to move. There are two special WinID
;;                          values supported:
;;
;;                          1) The value "A" means to use the Active window (default).
;;                          2) The value "M" means to use the window currently under the Mouse.
;;
;;      DoubleColumns      Can be either 1 or 0. 1 means that on a ultra wide monitor, where thirds are used, 
;;                         two coulmn steps are used so that a window can take 2/3 of the screen.
;;
;;      Column             Can be 0 or more. When 0, Fling3 flings window as expected, when giving a column > 0,
;;                         the window is flinged to this position ignoring the Direction setting
;;                         When DoubleCoumn = 1 is used, the column is extended to the right, the last column is extended to the left
;;                         (e.g. column 1 is then a double column over 1 and 2)
;;
;; Minimized windows are not modified; they are left exactly where they were.
;;
;; The return value of the function is non-zero if the window was successfully flung.
